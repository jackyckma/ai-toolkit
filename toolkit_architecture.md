# AI-Toolkit Self-Analysis

This is a demonstration of the AI-Native Development Toolkit analyzing itself. 

The toolkit's key components include:

- **Knowledge Graph (kb/)**: Stores the component and relationship data
- **Parser (parser/)**: Analyzes code to extract components and relationships
- **CLI (cli/)**: Provides the command-line interface
- **Visualization (viz/)**: Generates diagrams from the knowledge graph

## Conceptual Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    cli[CLI] --> kb[Knowledge Graph]
    cli --> parser[Parser]
    cli --> viz[Visualization]
    parser --> kb
    viz --> kb
    
    subgraph Knowledge Graph
        components[components.json]
        relationships[relationships.json]
    end
    
    subgraph Parser
        python[Python Parser]
        extractor[Component Extractor]
        dependency[Dependency Analyzer]
    end
    
    subgraph Visualization
        mermaid[Mermaid Generator]
    end
    
    subgraph CLI
        main[main.py]
        commands[commands/]
    end
```

While the current implementation is a prototype with placeholder functionality, this diagram illustrates the conceptual architecture of the toolkit.

## Next Steps for Development

1. Implement full Python parser functionality in `parser/python.py`
2. Enhance the knowledge graph storage in `kb/storage.py`
3. Add more visualization formats in `viz/formats/`
4. Expand query capabilities in `cli/commands/query.py`
